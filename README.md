# DME_MECH
Starter code for the basic chassis components.
Refer to the notes for how to wire up your components. This code will allow you to move the wheels/arm with your remote. 
This is just a minimal example to get you started. Using the IR remote for control is slow and clunky, i.e. not a good idea for the final design.

Download the example code (in the folder) and open it in the Arduino IDE, then upload to your Adafruit board.
